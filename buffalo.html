            <p class="card-text">
            It all started in Buffalo, NY - my hometown - in 2004 volunteering on Brian Higgins congressional campaign. The race was what insiders called a red-to-blue race and both political parties were dumping resources into Buffalo to win. It was something I had never seen before. I was working at Joe Slade White, a national media consulting firm in Buffalo, as a media buyer. Buying up time on TV and radio for political ads for races across the country. But on those races, I only got to see it from a distance. So, when Brian Higgins’ campaign was looking for volunteers, I jumped right in. I was going door-to-door or making phone calls to registered voters talking to them about why I was voting for Brian Higgins to be my congressman.</p>
            <p class="card-text">
            While all this excitement was happening, I made friendships and connections in DC that I still have today. I met a boy who was working on Capitol Hill and came to Buffalo to volunteer for this hot race for the 2004 campaign year and fell in love with him. I had always wanted to live in Washington, DC. I interned there during college and had been trying to get a job there for years. This moment in time would set up my long journey to Washington, DC. I just didn’t know it yet.

                In 2005, I left my job at Joe Slade White and became the Regional Director for the Healthcare Education Project. My previous boss, now working for SEIU 1199, hired me to work for her on the Healthcare Education Project because of all the door-to-door work I had done on Brian Higgins race as a volunteer.</p>
                <p class="card-text">It was a state-wide initiative to protect Medicaid funding in New York State’s 2006 budget. I managed a team of canvassers who went door to door in the winter months in Buffalo, NY.  They gave Buffalonians the opportunity to have a voice. Through postcards, phone calls, and personal letters, voters let their New York State representatives know that they did not want to see nursing homes closed by these cuts in the Governor’s proposed budget.</p>
                <p class="card-text">They were so successful that my canvassers, drudging through the snow, not only stopped the budget cuts but also got the state legislature to pass its budget on time, which had not been done in years. </p>
